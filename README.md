Assignment

Analyze an existing recommender system that you find
interesting and perform a Scenario Design analysis on the system.Â  Consider whether it makes sense for your
selected recommender system to perform scenario design twice, once for the
organization (e.g. Amazon.com) and once for the organization's customers. 

Attempt to reverse engineer what you can about the site,
from the site interface and any available information that you can find on the
Internet or elsewhere.

Include specific recommendations about how to improve the
site's recommendation capabilities going forward.
